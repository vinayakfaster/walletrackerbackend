Express Web Server with Ethereum Integration
This Express web server is designed to integrate with the Ethereum blockchain using the Web3.js library. It provides endpoints for fetching Ethereum blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, and querying token prices from decentralized exchanges.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Make sure you have an Ethereum node running or use a service like Infura for web3 provider.
Update the Ethereum provider URL in the web3 initialization.
Replace the placeholder values with your actual contract addresses and ABI definitions.
Configure your API keys for external services like Bitquery and Dexscreener.
Run npm start to start the Express server.
The server will start running on port 5002 by default.
Endpoints
/getweb3data: Fetch Ethereum blockchain data including token details and trading information.
/getwalletbalance: Retrieve wallet balances for Ethereum addresses.
/getMyPosition: Get position details from Ethereum smart contracts.
/getTokenPrice: Fetch token prices from decentralized exchanges.
